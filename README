This project is done in collaboration with Caio Vigo. 

The project uses two datasets (one on breast cancer and one on income) with binary outcomes. The neural network trains on 
80 percent of the data and tests on 20 percent of the data in each dataset. The neural network is trying to predict the binary 
outcome using the attributes in each dataset.
